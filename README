ABOUT

Wolpertinger is a subtractive synth with a sharp bandpass filter whose center
frequency "bounces" around the frequency of the playing notes. Thanks to the
Juce library it can be used both as a standalone application supporting JACK
or ALSA audio outputs, and as a VST instrument.

INSTALLATION

The executable binary should run out of the box, no installation needed. The
VST shared object (.so) is meant to be loaded into VST-compatible host
applications, e. g. Renoise.



BUILDING

To build your binaries yourself do the following.

1. Check out the code from the subversion repository:

	svn co svn://svn.tuxfamily.org/svnroot/tumbetoene/wolpertinger/tags/0.4 wolpertinger-0.4

2. Get JUCE 1.51 from http://www.rawmaterialsoftware.com/downloads.php

3. Edit juce_Config.h to your liking. Jack must be enabled if you want Jack support, OpenGL
	should be disabled.

4. Build Juce:

	cd build/linux; make && make CONFIG=Release

Juce may need Premake 3.7 to build -- http://premake.sourceforge.net/download

5. (Optional) If you want to build the VSTi, put the VST 2.4 SDK into a subdirectory
'vstsdk2.4' alongside the wolpertinger directory. You can get the SDK from
http://www.steinberg.net/ after doing whatever Steinberg wants you to do (mostly
providing a valid email address and staring at their ads for a while).
If you don't have the SDK, the VSTi build will fail, but the standalone version will
still be built.

6. Build Wolpertinger.

	./runpremake
	make; make config=release
