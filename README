tumbetoene: Wolpertinger v0.1

Wolpertinger is a subtractive synth with a sharp bandpass filter whose center frequency "bounces" around the frequency of the playing notes. Thanks to the Juced library it can be used both as a standalone application supporting JACK or ALSA audio outputs, and as a VST instrument.
