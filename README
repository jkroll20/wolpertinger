ABOUT

Wolpertinger is a subtractive synth with a bandpass filter whose center 
frequency "bounces" around the frequency of the playing notes. Thanks to the
Juce library it can be used both as a standalone application supporting JACK
or ALSA audio outputs, and as a VST instrument for (Linux) VST hosts.

INSTALLATION

The executable binary should run out of the box, no installation needed. The
VST shared object (.so) is meant to be loaded into VST-compatible host
applications, e. g. Renoise. Check your host documentation for native Linux
VST support. 

The included Win32 DLL can be loaded into Linux hosts which only support 
Windows VSTs, such as LMMS. This is experimental and not recommended. If 
possible, use the native Linux VST under Linux!


BUILDING

To build your binaries yourself do the following.

1. Check out the code from the subversion repository:

	svn co svn://svn.tuxfamily.org/svnroot/tumbetoene/wolpertinger/tags/0.4 wolpertinger-0.4

2. (Optional) If you want to build the VSTi, put the VST 2.4 SDK into a subdirectory
'vstsdk2.4' alongside the wolpertinger directory. You can get the SDK from
http://www.steinberg.net/ after doing whatever Steinberg wants you to do (mostly
providing a valid email address and staring at their ads for a while).

3. Build Wolpertinger. Amalgamated JUCE is now included for easier building, so 
usually all you need to do is:

	make

You can run "make config=debug" to build unoptimized binaries with debugging symbols. 
Run "make help" for make options.

If you want to use your own copy of JUCE or adjust other build options, you need
premake 4 from http://industriousone.com/premake. You can edit the premake4.lua 
script and regenerate the Makefiles by running the "runpremake" script.
